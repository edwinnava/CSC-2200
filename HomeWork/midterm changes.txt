Changes that I have done to the bootstrap midterm- 
I added the figcaption tag so that I can have a caption that is under the image and it doesnt wrap. 
I removed the table from the div tag that contains the picture so that the table is now right next to the big sale image. 
I also added the blue border behind the big sale image and the red box all the way to the right. 
Styled the text in the footer with internal styling 
instead of using <span> to change to the font color i used the td style tag to change the color. 
I made the col responive by adding col-lg 4 to all of them and then col-md 6 to the table and col-md 3 for the other two

<h1> Example Relative Vs Absolute </h1>
<div class='container'>
  Bears fans don't need to be reminded about how one-sided the rivalry with the Packers has been over the last couple of decades.
  Chicago has lost 20 of the last 23 regular-season meetings - and they haven't won since 2018 - which has always made those games twice a year miserable for Bears fans.
  <p />
  You also don't need to tell quarterback Justin Fields about the
  importance of this rivalry, and most importantly,
  flipping it back in favor of Chicago.

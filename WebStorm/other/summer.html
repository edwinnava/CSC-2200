<h2> About Me </h2>
<body>
I was born in Evanston, IL. I moved to Romeoville when I was still young, so I basically grew up in Romeoville.
I went to Romeoville High School where I played varsity soccer for 4 years. I played soccer since I was 12 years old,
my biggest accomplishment was winning a national championship. I stopped playing after I tore my ACL last year playing for the school.
All I mainly do right now is work at an Amazon warehouse, and workout to stay in shape.
